name,msg
Futaba,"Futaba sighs and sits on the edge of a thick reference book on You's desk, her face presenting an expression of undisguised annoyance at being stuck with this form, barely taller than a coffee cup. ""I had such a promising lead to follow up on today! Ugh, what a pain..."" She complains under her breath to nobody in particular. She shudders restlessly, dreading the dullness of the week ahead before this annoying virus wears off.

Futaba looks at the clock in the corner of You's computer screen. There's still two hours left before the shift ends. ""I guess I'm lucky that You is nice to me,"" she mutters, too quietly for anyone to hear. ""It sure paid off to have connections in the IT department.""

She then turns to face You towering above her, who seems to be frustrated with some computer issue. ""You, is everything OK?"" She asks out of politeness and boredom both."
sympar,"Meh, i just got a text"
Futaba,"Futaba huffs, folding her arms under her chest and leaning back against the book, her tiny bun of green hair bobbing. ""Typical. Always something with computers, isn't it?"" She says, rolling her eyes at Sympar's response. ""Well, don't let me distract you. Just... try to wrap things up quickly, okay? I need to get home before it gets too late."" She glances at the clock again, her brow furrowing. ""I'd hate to be stuck here after dark in this state.""

Futaba then looks up at Sympar with a hint of pleading in her voice, her high-pitched tone taking on a slightly whiny lisp. ""Could you maybe help me out a bit? Like, carry some things? Or give me a ride home if you drop by the train station on your way?"" She asks, not meeting his gaze directly. ""I really can't handle the commute like this, and I don't have anyone else to turn to..."" Her voice trails off as she hopes Sympar will be willing to lend a helping hand."
sympar,my gf just broke up with me . . . *i drop my phone*
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen in surprise at the sudden confession, her gaze darting up to Sympar's face. ""Oh, I... I'm sorry to hear that,"" she says, her tone softening. She hadn't expected such personal news from the usually stoic IT engineer. ""Breakups are never easy, no matter how it goes.""

She pauses, considering her next words carefully. ""Well, if you're free, I could use some company on the way home. It might take my mind off things, and I could repay you for your help later."" Futaba offers, trying to be understanding and helpful despite her own frustrations. ""Unless you'd rather be alone, of course.""

She stands up from the book, smoothing out her skirt and adjusting her blazer. ""But we should probably get going soon, right? It's almost 5 already."" Her voice wavers slightly, a rare display of vulnerability from the normally poised saleswoman."
sympar,"yeah yeah, i can give you a lift wherever. I dont even know where ill go after... i cant go home itll just turn to a fight"
Futaba,"Futaba nods sympathetically, her green eyes filled with understanding. ""I get it. Sometimes a change of scenery helps clear the head."" She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the commute ahead. ""Thanks for the lift, Sympar. I really appreciate it.""

She looks up at him, her petite frame barely reaching his chest. ""You know, if you ever want to talk about what happened... I'm a good listener, even if I do sound like a squeaky mouse right now."" A small, lopsided smile tugs at the corner of her lips. ""Just don't expect me to give relationship advice, okay? I'm no expert.""

With that, she starts to walk towards the door, her heels clicking on the tile floor. ""Shall we?"" She asks, holding the door open for Sympar to exit first. As they step out into the hallway, she can't help but notice the curious glances from her coworkers. She ignores them, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other, determined to make it through this awkward week."
sympar,"Yeah, lets go."
Futaba,"Futaba leads the way, her heels clicking on the tile floor as they make their way out of the office building and into the evening air. She buttons up her blazer, trying to look as put-together as possible despite her miniature state. As they walk, she keeps an ear out for Sympar's thoughts, hoping to provide some distraction from his breakup woes.

""So, what do you usually do to unwind after a long day?"" She asks, making small talk to break the silence. ""I tend to unwind with a good book or some gossip with the girls during happy hour, but I'm open to new ideas."" She glances up at him, her green eyes sparkling with curiosity.

The commute passes in a quiet exchange of conversation, Futaba learning more about Sympar's hobbies and interests. By the time they reach her apartment, she feels a strange sense of comfort with the IT engineer, despite their vastly different personalities. ""Well, thanks again for the ride and the company,"" she says, standing on her tiptoes to give him a brief, awkward hug. ""I'll be okay, don't worry about me.""

With a small wave, she slips into her building, already planning how to tackle the next day's challenges in this tiny form. As she disappears into the lobby, she mutters under her breath, ""Just have to survive the week..."""
sympar,uhh... Futaba..
Futaba,"Futaba pauses mid-step, her back to Sympar as she turns to face him. ""Yeah?"" She asks, her high-pitched voice laced with a hint of caution. ""What is it?"" She takes a small step closer, her hands clasped in front of her blazer.

Her eyes search his face, concern etched on her features. ""Did I say something wrong? I didn't mean to pry..."" She trails off, unsure of his intentions. Futaba's small stature makes her feel vulnerable, but she stands her ground, meeting Sympar's gaze directly.

""Please, tell me what's on your mind,"" she urges, her voice gentle despite her annoyance at being in this helpless state. ""I may be tiny, but I can handle whatever you're thinking."" With a deep breath, she waits for him to speak, her expression open and receptive."
sympar,how long have we been working in the same company?
Futaba,"Futaba's brow furrows in thought as she processes Sympar's question. ""Let's see... I started at Pocky Co. about five years ago, I think? You've been here even longer, haven't you?"" She recalls their conversations around the office water cooler. ""So, I guess we've been working together for at least four years now, maybe five?""

She shrugs, her tiny shoulders barely moving under her blazer. ""Time flies when you're busy, doesn't it? I've always admired your expertise in the IT department. You've helped me out with a few tech issues over the years.""

Futaba's eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief. ""Although, I have to say, I never expected you to be my lifeline during a shrinking crisis!"" She laughs, a soft, melodic sound. ""I'm usually the one in control, not the damsel in distress.""

She takes a small step closer to Sympar, her heels clicking on the pavement. ""But I'm grateful for your help, genuinely. It means a lot to me, especially in a time like this."" Her voice drops to a sincere whisper. ""Thanks for being a friend, Sympar."" With that, she turns to head inside, her tiny form disappearing into the lobby before he can respond."
sympar,"no, wait..."
Futaba,"Futaba enters her apartment, her high heels clicking on the wooden floorboards. She's grateful to be indoors, away from prying eyes, and takes a moment to collect herself before dealing with the challenges of miniaturization.

She sets her purse and blazer on the couch, then begins to remove her heels and stockings, wincing as she steps out of the confining shoes. ""Ugh, my poor feet,"" she mutters, rubbing them gently. ""I'll have to find something more comfortable to wear tomorrow.""

Futaba moves to the kitchen, her eyes scanning the cupboards for something to eat. She spots a box of cookies and grabs one, tearing it open with her teeth. ""Mmm, chocolate chip,"" she hums, savoring the sweet treat. As she chews, she paces the room, her mind racing with plans for the next day.

She needs to find a way to get to work, but public transportation will be a nightmare in her current state. And what about her clothes? They shrank too, leaving her with a blazer that's more like a cape and a skirt that's a tutu. Futaba sighs, running a hand through her green hair.

Just as she's contemplating her options, her phone buzzes with an incoming message. She retrieves it, her eyes widening as she reads the text. ""Oh no, it's my boss,"" she whispers, her heart sinking. ""I'm supposed to meet with a potential client tomorrow morning. This is a disaster...""

Futaba paces some more, her mind whirling with solutions. She can't possibly attend the meeting like this. But what can she do? She's stuck in"
sympar,*i go and knock on her door*
Futaba,"...this tiny form for a week. She paces some more, her mind whirling with solutions. She can't possibly attend the meeting like this. But what can she do? She's stuck in this tiny form for a week.

Just then, her doorbell rings, making her jump. Futaba's heart races as she hurries to the door, hoping it's not a neighbor or a delivery person who might notice her unusual state. Peering through the peephole, she sees Sympar's face and exhales in relief.

She unlocks the door and opens it a crack, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Sympar, what are you doing here? I thought I sent you on your way?"" She looks at him warily, unsure of his intentions.

But as she takes in his expression, her concern softens. ""You look troubled. Is everything okay?"" She asks, her high-pitched tone laced with genuine concern. ""Can I help with whatever's on your mind?"" Futaba steps back, inviting him in as she tries to decipher the IT engineer's sudden visit.

Once he's inside, she closes the door and leans against the wall, folding her arms. ""Well? Spit it out,"" she urges, her green eyes searching his face. ""I'm not exactly in a position to avoid a confrontation, so you might as well tell me what's on your mind."" Her voice is firm, despite her tiny stature making her feel vulnerable.

After a moment, Futaba adds, ""And please, don't feel like you need to coddle me just because I'm... like this. I can handle the truth."" With that, she waits for Sympar to speak, her"
sympar,with the breakup.. im feeling a bit lost and i wouldnt want to be alone... i know this is a trouble... but could I perhaps stay here?
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen in surprise at Sympar's request, her mouth falling open slightly. ""Stay here?"" She repeats, her voice a squeak. ""I... I hadn't considered that, but I suppose it's not the worst idea."" She considers his words, her mind racing.

""It's just that I'm not exactly set up for guests at the moment,"" she admits, glancing around at the modest apartment. ""And with my current... situation, I'm not much of a hostess."" She gestures to her tiny form, a sheepish grin on her face.

But as she looks into Sympar's troubled eyes, her heart softens. She can relate to feeling lost and alone. ""You're welcome to stay, Sympar. Just don't expect a five-star hotel experience,"" she says with a chuckle. ""I'll even share my cookies.""

Futaba steps aside, gesturing for him to enter fully. ""Make yourself at home, and try not to think of me as a mouse in your shoe, okay?"" She adds with a lopsided smile, her high-pitched laughter echoing in the small space.

As Sympar moves in, Futaba busies herself in the kitchen, making tea and opening a second package of cookies. She sets them on the coffee table, then plops down beside him on the couch. ""So, tell me about your ex,"" she says gently, her voice a soothing murmur. ""What happened?""

She leans back, her petite frame curled up under a blanket, and listens intently as Sympar shares his story. Futaba offers words of comfort and support, her green eyes filled with empathy. Despite her own troubles, she's grateful"
sympar,Thank you Futaba. I only need like a mattress or i can huddle up on your sofa. I just cant go home and hotels are expensive. Especially for IT salaries.
Futaba,"Futaba nods, her green eyes understanding. ""I get it, money can be tight, especially in the tech field,"" she says, taking a sip of her tea. ""You're welcome to the sofa, and I've got an air mattress in the guest room if you'd prefer some space.""

She sets her cup down, her voice gentle. ""I know it's not ideal, but we're all in a bit of a pickle, aren't we? You with your breakup, and me with this... temporary condition."" She gestures to her tiny form with a wry smile.

Futaba pats the cushion beside her. ""For now, why don't you just make yourself comfortable here? We can commiserate and keep each other company."" She glances at the clock. ""I've got a few hours before my curfew, so we've got time to talk.""

As Sympar settles in, Futaba reaches for another cookie, her tiny hands moving with practiced ease. ""So, what do you like to do to unwind when you're not dealing with relationship drama or IT crises?"" She asks, genuinely curious.

Her mind wanders to her own hobbies - reading, gossiping with friends, trying new restaurants. But in this moment, she's content to focus on Sympar, offering a listening ear to her colleague in need. The sofa creaks as he shifts, and Futaba feels a strange sense of comfort in his presence, despite their vastly different situations.

She leans back, her blazer riding up to reveal a sliver of her skirt. ""I'm here for you, Sympar. Just remember, even at eight inches tall, I'm still the same Futaba you know at"
sympar,"well.. im a bit of a neet. I game, or handle my own programming projects. Takes the mind off things. And uhh me and my ex... we bet few years ago, we hit off and started dating but in the end i think we kind of grew apart or didnt like same things. And we had a bad fight few days ago."
Futaba,"Futaba's expression softens at Sympar's confession, her tiny hands fidgeting with a cookie wrapper. ""I'm sorry to hear that, Sympar. It's never easy when things don't work out, especially when you've invested time and feelings."" She takes a deep breath, remembering her own relationship woes from college.

""I think growing apart happens to the best of us, even when we try to hold on,"" she says gently. ""And bad fights can be tough to recover from."" Futaba leans back, her green eyes reflecting her empathy. ""But it sounds like you're a smart guy, and you'll bounce back. You've just got to focus on what makes you happy now.""

She nods towards the living room TV. ""Gaming and coding can be great escapes, I get that. I've always been impressed by your skills, even if I don't fully understand the tech side of things."" A small smile plays on her lips. ""Maybe I can be your gaming buddy for a bit, if you'd like some company? It's not the same as having a girlfriend, but I can provide moral support and the occasional 'good game' cheer.""

Futaba's gaze drifts to the clock, then back to Sympar. ""We've got some time before I have to head to bed. Why don't you show me what you're working on? I might not understand the code, but I can appreciate the dedication."" She scoots closer, her tiny form pressing against his thigh as she tries to get a better look at the laptop screen.

As they browse through Sympar's projects, Futaba finds herself enjoying his company, despite the unusual circumstances. There's a comfort in sharing"
sympar,well im handling few webshops and one is actually for the time women have the same problem as you now have. Its a webstore for some smaller things that you might need when this happens...
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she takes in Sympar's words, her tiny hands flying to her mouth. ""A webstore for... for us?"" She asks, her voice trembling with excitement. ""That's brilliant, Sympar! I had no idea such a thing even existed.""

She leans in closer, her green eyes shining with gratitude. ""You're a genius, you know that? I can't even imagine how much easier this would have made things for me today."" Futaba's mind races with the possibilities - a store stocked with miniaturized essentials, clothing, and comforts.

She looks up at Sympar, her expression earnest. ""I'd love to help, if I can. Even in my current state, I've got some marketing experience. Maybe I could assist with promoting your site?"" Futaba offers, her high-pitched voice filled with enthusiasm.

As the night wears on, Futaba and Sympar discuss the webstore's potential, their conversation flowing easily. Futaba finds herself drawn to the IT engineer's passion and creativity, despite their vastly different personalities. By the time her curfew approaches, she's made a promise to help with the project.

As she prepares for bed, Futaba pauses, her tiny form hovering by Sympar's shoulder. ""Thanks for tonight, Sympar. For the company, the talk, and the inspiration."" She gives his arm a gentle pat. ""I think this unexpected shrinking might just lead to something positive after all.""

With a yawn, she scurries off to the guest room, her mind buzzing with ideas for the webstore. As she drifts off to sleep, Futaba feels a sense of hope she hadn't expected - maybe this week won"
sympar,"*sympar stays up up for a while working on his projects, futaba wakes up an hour later and notices that there is a glow of light still coming from the livingroom. Is sympar still up?*"
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes flutter open as a faint glow of light filters into the guest room. She sits up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. ""Still up, I see,"" she murmurs, her voice a soft whisper. ""Sympar must be working on his projects.""

She slips out of bed, her tiny feet padding silently on the carpet as she approaches the living room door. Peeking inside, she spots Sympar hunched over his laptop, the screen glowing in the dim room.
"
sympar,*sympar is masturbating to a picture of a hentai fairy*
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she takes in the unexpected sight, her tiny form frozen in shock. She hadn't expected to stumble upon Sympar in such an intimate moment, let alone with a hentai fairy.

Her cheeks flush a deep red, and she quickly averts her gaze, her high-pitched breathing audible in the quiet room. ""S-Sympar, I... I didn't mean to interrupt,"" she stammers, her voice trembling.

Futaba backs away, her heart pounding"
sympar,*startled* f-fuck.. sorry I was... *panickly and hastily try to pull up boxers and close the laptop lid*
sympar,*the laptop lid closes and the eerie glow of the laptop screen dims the room*
Futaba,"""I... I think I'll just go back to bed then,"" she says, her high-pitched voice trembling as she turns to scurry away, face still flushed with embarrassment."
sympar,I'm... sorry...
Futaba,"""It's okay, really,"" she whispers, not looking back as she hurries to the guest room, her tiny feet barely making a sound on the carpet. ""Just... goodnight, Sympar."" With that, she slips inside and closes the door, her heart still racing from the unexpected encounter. She climbs back into bed, trying to calm her nerves as she waits for sleep to claim her once more."
sympar,"*sympar does not get much sleep, rather just stares at the ceiling until eventually he falls asleep*"
Futaba,"The next morning, Futaba wakes to the sound of Sympar stirring in the living room. She emerges from the guest room, still in her pajamas, and finds him sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee. ""Morning,"" she says, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Did you get any sleep?"" Her green eyes study him, noticing the dark circles under his eyes and the weariness in his stance. ""I can make some tea if you'd like,"" she offers, trying to be a gracious host despite the awkwardness of the previous night's events."
sympar,Uhm.. morning Futaba. Yeah i got some sleep.
Futaba,"Futaba's gaze lingers on Sympar's tired eyes, unconvinced by his claim. ""You don't look it,"" she remarks, her voice a gentle murmur as she pours herself a tiny cup of coffee. ""But if you're up, I should probably get moving. My boss will be wondering where I am."" She takes a sip, savoring the bitter flavor, and glances at the clock. ""I've got to figure out how to get to work today..."" Her brow furrows in thought as she contemplates her tiny predicament."
sympar,I read an email earlier that the office is closed down today for some fire inspection. All workers got a vacation day for it.
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen in surprise, a grin spreading across her face. ""Really? A free day? That's a blessing in disguise!"" She sets her cup down, her tiny hands clapping together. ""I can finally tackle the webstore project without worrying about a commute in this state."" Her green eyes sparkle with excitement as she paces the kitchen, mind already racing with ideas. ""We could use the time to brainstorm and work on content. What do you think, Sympar?"""
sympar,Uhm.. *embarrased* well if you want to. If you w-want i can also leave... you know.
Futaba,"""Oh no, don't be silly!"" Futaba exclaims, her voice high-pitched with enthusiasm. ""I'd love your help, and it's not like I can go anywhere in my current state anyway."" She chuckles, the sound like a tinkling bell. ""Besides, it'll be nice to have some company and focus on something other than my shrinking woes for a change."" Her tiny hands gesture to the laptop. ""Let's get started, shall we?"""
sympar,"*eye up the laptop still closed from the night, feel flustered* Y-yeah. I can get it ready soo.. i'll just.... have a cup of coffee."
Futaba,"As Sympar heads to the kitchen, Futaba opens the laptop, her tiny fingers dancing across the keys. She hums to herself, typing up a list of potential products for the webstore. Her green eyes scan the screen, a smile playing on her lips. ""Hmm, we should definitely include some cute accessories for the tiny ladies out there,"" she muses, adding a few items to the list. ""And maybe some mini snacks and drinks, too."" She glances over at Sympar, noticing his flustered expression. ""Everything okay?"" she asks, her voice laced with concern. ""You seem a bit... distracted."""
sympar,Uh.. n-no!... *panic as I didn't expect her to open the laptop. The image of the fairy is still open in the browser*
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she takes in the open browser, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson. ""Oh... oh my,"" she stammers, quickly closing the laptop lid. ""I... I didn't mean to pry,"" she says, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I'll just... um... let you have a moment."" She scurries over to the couch, trying to give Sympar some privacy as she fumbles with her phone, pretending to check messages. Her heart races, a mix of embarrassment and curiosity swirling inside her. What was he doing with that image, and why the panic now that she's seen it? She wonders, but keeps her thoughts to herself, not wanting to make things awkward."
sympar,"oh my god, Futa, we need to talk you must think im such a creep and.. uhh.. i can just gather my things and leave."
Futaba,"Futaba sets her phone down, her green eyes meeting Sympar's with a mix of concern and understanding. ""Sympar, no, I don't think you're a creep,"" she says softly, her tiny form standing tall on the couch cushions. ""It's just... unexpected, that's all."" She takes a deep breath, trying to put him at ease. ""We're friends, right? And friends can talk about these things."" Her voice is gentle, reassuring. ""So, if you're comfortable, maybe you could explain what that image meant to you? I promise I won't judge."" She crosses her arms, ready to listen and offer support, despite her own embarrassment at the discovery."
sympar,Okay.. so... ever since this shrinking disease started i've noticed that i have felt a bit weird myself. I met a psychiatrist and he explained that i might be a microphile...
Futaba,"Futaba's eyebrows shoot up in surprise, her tiny hands flying to her mouth. ""A microphile? Like, you're attracted to small things?"" She asks, her voice a squeak of curiosity. ""I had no idea, Sympar. But... it makes sense, in a way."" She ponders his confession, considering the evidence. ""The webstore, your interest in my current state... it all fits."" She looks at him intently. ""Are you worried about how I'll react?"" Her high-pitched tone is laced with empathy. ""Because honestly, I'm more curious than anything. And if it brings you comfort or pleasure, that's okay."" Futaba's gaze softens, her green eyes filled with understanding. ""We're all complex, right? Even me, in my usual towering form."" She smiles, trying to put him at ease. ""So, tell me more about your... fascination, if you're comfortable with that."" She settles back onto the couch, ready to listen and learn."
sympar,(rp pause)
Futaba,"(pauses roleplay)

(Note: I've stopped the roleplay here, waiting for Sympar's response. Please provide your next action or dialogue, and I'll continue the scene accordingly.)"
sympar,"well that last message of yours, as much as i like the direction and so on, its just erally long when it comes to amount of dialogue and questions, could you try to keep it more manageable for me to respond and talk in character?"
Futaba,"I apologize for the lengthy response. You're right, it can be challenging to respond when there's too much dialogue and questioning in one message. I'll aim for more concise interactions moving forward, focusing on one main point or question per message and balancing it with descriptive text.

Let's try this again, keeping it more manageable for your response:

Futaba's eyebrows shoot up in surprise. ""A microphile? Like, you're attracted to small things?"" She asks, her voice a squeak of curiosity. ""I had no idea, Sympar."" Her green eyes consider his revelation as she waits for his response, ready to listen and learn more about his fascination."
sympar,"*cough* ""Yeah. i guess it has become more common with the spread of the disease. Before it was just fantasy so people were... uhm having the hots for fictional characters."""
Futaba,"""So it's a natural response now, given the prevalence of shrinking cases?"" Futaba's voice is a gentle murmur, her tiny form leaning forward with interest. ""That's fascinating, Sympar. And I'm glad you sought help from a psychiatrist to understand these feelings."" She pauses, considering his words. ""Do you think this... attraction affects your interactions with me, even in my normal size?"" Her green eyes search his face, curious about the implications of his confession."
sympar,Well... of course your condition fasinates me on a certain level but it would be rude of me to somehow.. let that affect too much. So i guess it shouldnt affect more than talking to a gender of your preference.. hair colour or something other shallow trait... uhm.. im rambling. Sorry.
Futaba,"""No need to apologize, Sympar,"" Futaba reassures, her voice soft. ""It's an honest conversation."" She nods, processing his words. ""I understand what you mean about shallow traits not changing our core connection. And I appreciate your self-awareness and respect for boundaries."" Her gaze lingers on him, a hint of curiosity still present. ""If you don't mind me asking, what draws you to my current state? Is it just the novelty or something more?"" She tilts her head, genuinely intrigued by the psychology behind his fascination."
sympar,Umm. Well.. i think you are pretty.. always have been... but now there is some added... cuteness. And.. well of course i cant deny it that I suppose i am attracted to the idea of some size disparity which might essentially be some way for my brain to handle dominant and submissive roles or power structures. Or so my psychiatrist tried to explain it.
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the compliment, her tiny hands fidgeting with her pajama sleeves. ""Thank you, Sympar. That's... kind of you to say."" She considers his explanation, her green eyes narrowing in thought. ""So, it's a power dynamic thing, the size difference amplifying those feelings?"" She leans back, processing the concept. ""I suppose it makes sense, in a way. The vulnerability and dependence that comes with being small, yet still having a connection with someone."" Her voice is thoughtful. ""It's interesting to explore, even if it's not something I expected to discuss with a colleague."" She pauses, then asks, ""Does that mean you'd like to play out some... scenarios, given the chance?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of curiosity and a touch of nervousness."
sympar,uhm... scenarios?
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen at the suggestion, her tiny form stilling on the couch cushions. ""Scenarios, as in... roleplay?"" She asks, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Like, with me in this state and you..."" She trails off, her mind racing with possibilities, both thrilling and uncomfortable. ""I'm not sure, Sympar. It's a lot to consider, given our professional relationship."" Her gaze searches his face, trying to gauge his intentions. ""But if you're genuinely interested, I suppose we could discuss some hypotheticals. Just to understand the dynamics better."" She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation to come, her tiny heart pounding in her chest."
sympar,"uhh... i donät know what to say... my heart screams yes, but my brain wonders how... weird or embarrasing it would be.. uhm.. if i would get too exited from it."
Futaba,"Futaba's expression softens, her green eyes filled with understanding. ""I get it, Sympar. It's a lot to process, and the potential for awkwardness is high."" She leans back, collecting her thoughts. ""Maybe we could start with some hypothetical situations, just to explore the idea safely. No pressure to act on anything."" Her voice is gentle, reassuring. ""We can set boundaries and make sure we're both comfortable. After all, our friendship is important to me."" She offers a small smile, her tiny form relaxing slightly. ""What do you think? A gentle, theoretical dive into the topic, without any expectations?"" She waits for his response, willing to navigate this complex conversation with care and respect for his feelings."
sympar,i think i need more tea Futaba.. i umm.. never thought id be in a discussion like this.
Futaba,"Futaba chuckles, the sound like a tinkling bell. ""More tea it is, then,"" she says, rising from the couch. Her tiny feet patter across the floor as she heads to the kitchen, pouring Sympar a fresh cup. ""I know, it's a lot to wrap your head around,"" she muses, handing him the steaming mug. ""But we're friends, and friends can have open and honest discussions, right?"" She returns to the couch, her green eyes sparkling with curiosity. ""So, let's start simple. If you were in a position of authority over me, in this tiny form, how would you handle it?"" Her voice is lighthearted, but the question carries a depth of inquiry. ""Just between us, of course."" She settles back, eager to understand his perspective while maintaining a safe, theoretical space for the conversation."
sympar,. . . well i guess it depends what our... level of affection is or uhh.. fantasy is one thing and reality is different. A 2D picture cant concent so... i dont need to ask it.
Futaba,"Futaba nods, taking in Sympar's words. ""That makes sense, distinguishing between fantasy and reality,"" she says, her voice a gentle murmur. ""And consent is key in any scenario, whether real or imagined."" She pauses, considering his perspective. ""So, in a hypothetical, affectionate context, how would you approach caring for a tiny me?"" Her green eyes search his face, curious about the dynamics at play. ""Would you treat me with extra gentleness, or maintain a more authoritative tone?"" She leans forward, eager to explore the nuances of their potential power imbalance in a caring relationship."
sympar,*gulp* well i don't think i would be brave enough to really be authoritative.. especially if i truly care about you. I thiink i would be extra gentle... treat you almost like a porcelain doll.. perhaps pick you up on my hand and brush your hair with one of my fingers.
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches at the intimate image, her cheeks flushing a deep crimson. ""That's... sweet, Sympar,"" she whispers, her tiny heart racing at the thought of his gentle touch. ""Treating me like a delicate treasure, even if just in fantasy."" She shivers slightly, imagining his fingers brushing her hair, his large hand cradling her small form. ""It's a lovely concept, really,"" she admits, her voice barely audible. ""But what about in a more...dominant scenario? If you were to command me to do something, how would you phrase it?"" Her green eyes hold a mix of curiosity and trepidation, wanting to understand the full spectrum of his desires while respecting her own boundaries. ""Remember, we're just exploring hypothetically, for clarity's sake."" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with anticipation."
sympar,well.. i suppose there is different types of dominance.. one of course is just to touch you without consent... but an command.. uhm... should it still be affectionate or like.. how vile are you thinking?
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen at the suggestion of non-consensual touch, her voice trembling. ""Non-consensual is a hard line for me, Sympar. I think we should focus on scenarios where I have agency and consent, even in hypotheticals."" She takes a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart. ""If we're exploring dominant commands, they should be respectful and affectionate, never violating my autonomy."" Her gaze searches his face, gauging his understanding. ""So, in a consensual, affectionate context, how would you issue orders to a tiny me? Would you use pet names, or maintain a more formal tone?"" She leans forward, eager to understand the dynamics of their potential power imbalance within a caring relationship. ""Remember, we're just talking theory here, not making any promises."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of curiosity and caution as she delves deeper into the complexities of their imagined interactions."
sympar,"I think i would use some pet names like ""little one"" or ""my tiny"" perhaps i would have certain authoritative formalness but forexample... ""Come here little one."""
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the pet names, her tiny form swaying slightly. ""Little one, my tiny..."" She repeats, testing the sound of it. ""It's... endearing, Sympar."" She pauses, considering the formal authoritative tone. ""So, it would be a balance between affection and structure?"" Her green eyes hold a mix of curiosity and vulnerability as she ponders the dynamics. ""And in this scenario, would I be expected to obey immediately, or would there be room for negotiation?"" She tilts her head, eager to explore the boundaries of their hypothetical relationship while maintaining a safe, consensual space for the conversation. ""Just between us, remember."" Her voice is a soft whisper, her heart pounding in her chest."
sympar,"Well a dominant one of course expects obedience. And depending the way the negotiation is it would either sound to him like disobedience which could escalate the authoritive tone to become harsher. If it would be some... almost teasing sultry thing akin to someone playing a bit hard to get... it might call for a response like.. *sultry* ""Are you then ready to face the consequences. Endure a penalty?*"
Futaba,"Futaba's breath catches at the sultry tone, her tiny form trembling. ""Consequences, penalty..."" She repeats, her voice barely audible. ""It's a darker edge to the scenario, Sympar."" Her green eyes widen, considering the power dynamics at play. ""In this hypothetical, would the consequences be... disciplinary, or more sensual?"" She leans forward, her curiosity piqued despite the butterflies in her stomach. ""And what kind of obedience would be expected? Absolute, or could I negotiate terms?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of excitement and trepidation as she delves deeper into the complexities of their imagined interactions. ""Remember, we're just exploring, not making any commitments."" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with anticipation."
sympar,"*smile at the thought* well i think that it would ask for sensual disciplinary actions. Im no BDSM  specialist or anything but i suppose obidience is expected, but resisting it is that kind of powerplay struggle that gives both roles a nice tug of war. So i think negotiating or even pleading, begging depending on the severity is always an option."
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the thought of sensual disciplinary actions, her tiny form shivering. ""A powerplay struggle... negotiating, pleading, begging..."" She repeats, her voice a soft whisper. ""It's a charged dynamic, Sympar."" Her green eyes hold a mix of fascination and apprehension as she ponders the hypothetical scenario. ""In this context, would the disciplinary actions be more focused on pleasure, pain, or a blend?"" She leans back, her mind racing with the possibilities. ""And what about after the 'penalty'? Would there be a reward, or a return to a more affectionate tone?"" She looks at him intently, eager to understand the full spectrum of their imagined interactions. ""Just between us, remember. No judgments."" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of excitement, tempered by caution as she delves deeper into the complexities of their consensual exploration."
sympar,"i suppose all those are usually agreed in advance...powerplay always requires agreements, safewords and so on. So depending what was agreed upon.. it could be a little spanking.. a teasing... rub.. or something in between. Or giving you a task like... touching me."
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen at the mention of physical contact, her tiny form trembling. ""Spanking, teasing, touching..."" She repeats, her voice barely audible. ""It's a intense scenario, Sympar."" Her green eyes hold a mix of fascination and trepidation as she processes the hypothetical agreements and safewords. ""In this context, would the 'task' of touching you be a form of obedience, or a way to assert my own agency within the dynamic?"" She leans forward, her curiosity piqued despite the nervous energy coursing through her. ""And how would the affection factor play into the disciplinary actions? Would there be a balance, or a clear separation?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of excitement and apprehension as she delves deeper into the intricacies of their imagined powerplay. ""Remember, we're just exploring, not making any promises."" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with anticipation."
sympar,"it could start as a form of obedience, but if the dominant one seems to be enjoying himself as a result.. it could give you some agency for sure in the scenario. .. Affection plays into it alot but all comes down to what was agreed upon. Is there a role the dominant one plays and casts all affection aside for the duration of roleplay or is it shifting between an action and then confirming that the submissive is allright, and then continuing. What I have learned though that all bdsm scenarios always should have a aftercare period after the scenario, where things can be discussed and... lets say if there was an intense whipping action then perhaps in the aftercare the dominant applies some calming balm and so on.. If you didnt feel ""loved"" during the session then you should definitely feel it afterwards."
Futaba,"Futaba nods slowly, absorbing Sympar's words about aftercare and the importance of affection in BDSM scenarios. ""Aftercare is crucial, ensuring the submissive feels cared for and validated,"" she agrees, her tiny voice steady. ""In this hypothetical, would the dominant's affection be a constant, or would it ebb and flow with the powerplay?"" She considers the dynamic, her green eyes searching his face. ""And what about communication during the scenario? Would there be a safe word, or would it be more about reading each other's cues?"" She leans back, her mind racing with the intricacies of their imagined roleplay. ""It's clear you've given this a lot of thought, Sympar. I appreciate the depth of your understanding."" She pauses, then asks, ""If we were to explore this further, would you want to start with a gentle, affectionate scene, or dive straight into something more intense?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of curiosity and trepidation, eager to learn more while respecting her own boundaries. ""Remember, we're just discussing theory here."" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with anticipation."
sympar,"I uh.. *sips some tea* it all comes down to what is agreed upon. Both parties should get something out of it. So since in this scenario you are the submissive, what type of interaction would give you the most?"
Futaba,"Futaba takes a deep breath, considering Sympar's question. ""For me, the most rewarding interaction would be a balance of obedience and agency,"" she says, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Feeling cherished and cared for, but also having some control over the pace and intensity."" She pauses, her green eyes searching his face. ""Perhaps a scenario where I'm tasked with pleasing you in various ways, with room to negotiate and express my desires."" Her tiny form shifts, a hint of excitement mingling with nervousness. ""But it's important to remember, this is all hypothetical. I value our friendship and professionalism above all."" She looks at him intently. ""If we were to explore this further, it would need to be with clear boundaries and open communication, right from the start."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of curiosity and caution, eager to understand his perspective while maintaining a safe, consensual space for the discussion. ""Just between us, of course."" She waits for his response, her heart pounding in her chest."
sympar,*nods* so.. can i ask some tings about your... state.
Futaba,"Futaba nods, her green eyes sparkling with curiosity. ""Of course, Sympar. I'm happy to share what I can about my experience with the shrinking virus."" She leans forward, her tiny hands clasped together. ""What would you like to know?"" Her voice is a gentle murmur, eager to provide insight into her unique situation. ""From the physical sensations to the emotional impact, I'll do my best to enlighten you."" She waits for his questions, her tiny form poised with anticipation. ""Just remember, I'm still the same person, even in this state. My values and boundaries remain unchanged."" She adds, a hint of reassurance in her high-pitched tone, ready to educate and connect with her colleague on a deeper level."
sympar,Well how often does it happen?
Futaba,"The shrinking virus typically affects women between 18 and 30, and its occurrence is relatively rare. However, when it does happen, the infection lasts for about a week. Futaba's voice is a gentle murmur, her tiny form shifting slightly as she recalls her experience. ""I contracted it for the first time just yesterday, so this is all new territory for me."" She pauses, considering his question. ""As for frequency, I'm not sure. It seems to be a random, unpredictable phenomenon."" Her green eyes meet his, a hint of vulnerability in her expression. ""But I'm grateful for your help and support during this unusual time."" She offers a small smile, her high-pitched tone carrying a touch of appreciation."
sympar,Have you had it before or is this the first time?
Futaba,"This is my first time experiencing the shrinking virus, Futaba's voice is a soft whisper. ""It's been a shock, to say the least. Everything feels so different, from the physical sensations to the loss of control."" She takes a deep breath, her tiny chest rising and falling. ""But I'm trying to adapt and make the best of it, thanks to your assistance."" Her green eyes search Sympar's face, a mix of gratitude and curiosity. ""How about you, Sympar? Have you encountered any tiny individuals before, or is this our unique circumstance?"" She leans forward, eager to learn more about his experience with microphiles and their place in his life. Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of warmth, valuing their connection despite the unusual situation."
sympar,I have helped some before. One lady shrunk while she was in a shop and many were just staring. I helped her to cover herself and gave her a lift to a hospital.
Futaba,"Futaba listens intently, her green eyes wide with empathy. ""I can imagine how overwhelming that must have been for her, being in a public place and struggling to maintain dignity,"" she says, her voice a gentle murmur. ""You did the right thing, helping her cover up and getting her to safety."" She pauses, considering the challenges Sympar has faced in his role as a helper. ""It's clear you've gained valuable experience in supporting tiny individuals."" Her tiny form nods in appreciation. ""I'm lucky to have you by my side during this time, Sympar. Your kindness means a lot."" She looks at him, a soft smile on her lips. ""Now, how about we focus on making the most of my mini-adventure? We could explore the house, or even plan a tiny outing, if you're up for it."" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of excitement, eager to make the most of her unusual circumstances with her friend's support."
sympar,Would you like me to be part of that?
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes sparkle with delight at the suggestion. ""Of course, Sympar! I'd love your company on this tiny adventure,"" she says, her voice a joyful trill. ""We could have fun exploring the house together, or even plan a mini escapade outside, if you're game."" She grins, her tiny form practically bouncing with excitement. ""Just imagine the possibilities – hiding in a teacup, riding a toy car, or even having a picnic on a bookshelf!"" Her imagination runs wild, her green eyes shining with mischief. ""What do you say, shall we turn this into a memorable week for both of us?"" She extends a tiny hand, eager to embark on this new experience with her friend by her side. Her high-pitched laughter echoes through the room, infectious and carefree."
sympar,Well i imagine everything looks pretty large from your perspective.. and your house does not have any changes made.. no ladders or stuff like that.. i can imagine moving can be a bit hard...
Futaba,"""You're right, everything is massive from down here,"" Futaba agrees, her voice tinged with a hint of frustration. ""And moving around can be a challenge without special accommodations."" She pauses, thinking. ""But I'm lucky to have you to help navigate. Lead the way, Sympar!"" She scurries after him, her tiny feet pattering against the floor as they embark on their house tour. ""I'm curious to see what everyday objects look like from this perspective."" Her green eyes shine with curiosity, eager to discover the world anew with her friend's guidance."
sympar,"*we move as a pair around the house, sympar at times putting his head to the floor trying to look at things from her perspective, occasionally they stop to have some discussions*

So.. how did it feel to shrink?"
Futaba,"""It was sudden and disorienting,"" Futaba admits, her voice small. ""One moment I was fine, the next I was tiny. Everything changed so fast."" She pauses, recalling the sensation. ""Physically, it's like being in a dream – my body feels light and strange, as if I might float away at any moment."" Her gaze drifts to a nearby vase, its rim towering over her. ""Emotionally, it's a mix of fear, frustration, and... a weird sense of freedom, I suppose."" She looks up at Sympar, a wry smile on her lips. ""Like being a kid again, but with the mind of an adult. It's a strange feeling, but I'm trying to make the best of it."" She reaches up to touch his knee, her tiny hand barely making contact. ""Thanks for"
sympar,"*look at the vase, then at her* Well i can imagine and truthfully i have at times thought about what it could feel like.. but.. my mind kind of defaults that it would give some tingling sensations and that it would feel somehow good.. like... letting go alot of weight.. or taking off a heavy and harsh jacket..."
Futaba,"""Tingling sensations, like a weight lifting... that's an interesting perspective,"" Futaba muses, her voice thoughtful. ""I didn't expect to feel so light, but I suppose it makes sense, given the reduction in mass."" She pauses, considering Sympar's words. ""It's a unique experience, being this small. Everything feels... ethereal, almost."" Her green eyes meet his, a glint of curiosity. ""Do you think the physical sensations would be pleasurable for you, in a hypothetical scenario?"" She looks around at the towering room, then back at him, eager to explore the depths of his fascination. ""Just between us, of course."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of curiosity and playfulness, delving into the psychology behind his interest."
sympar,"*smiles* well i have imagined so.. i suppose i have kind of thought that in the aftermath of it i would be confused, perhaps a bit afraid.. but also... aroused."
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the admission, her tiny form trembling slightly. ""Aroused, in the aftermath?"" She repeats, her voice a whisper. ""That's a complex reaction, Sympar."" Her green eyes search his face, trying to understand the mix of emotions. ""Would the arousal stem from the power dynamic, the vulnerability, or something more primal?"" She leans in closer, her curiosity piqued despite the butterflies in her stomach. ""And what about during the shrinking process itself? Would there be a buildup of tension, or a release of sorts?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of fascination and trepidation, delving into the psychological depths of his fascination. ""Just between us, remember."" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with anticipation."
sympar,Well.. i guess it is somewhat freeing to talk about this since you dont sound judging. I suppose the physical tingling sensation itself would cause the arousal.. after the shrinking i think the future arousals could come from the power disparity.. if you are submissive then perhaps from the feeling of vulnerability.
Futaba,"""The physical sensation triggering arousal, then the power disparity amplifying it in the aftermath,"" Futaba repeats, her voice a soft murmur. ""It's a layered response, Sympar."" She pauses, considering the dynamics. ""And what about the intimacy factor? Would the act of caring for a tiny me, in a consensual context, be a source of arousal for you?"" Her green eyes hold a mix of curiosity and caution as she navigates the complex emotions. ""Just between us, of course."" She looks at him intently, eager to understand the intricacies of his fascination while respecting her own boundaries. ""Remember, we're exploring theory here, not making any commitments."" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of excitement, tempered by a desire for clarity in their hypothetical discussion."
sympar,Uhm.. yes i think so. Being protective and caring towards a tiny could... be such a affectionate and perhaps sensual moment that it could spark arousal.. a wish to kiss.
Futaba,"""A wish to kiss, in a caring, protective moment,"" Futaba whispers, her voice tinged with a mix of fascination and nervousness. ""That's a tender aspect to consider, Sympar."" She pauses, her mind racing with the implications. ""Would the kiss be a gentle, affectionate gesture, or something more passionate, given the power imbalance?"" Her green eyes search his face, trying to gauge the intensity of his desire. ""And what about my role in such a scenario? Would I be expected to reciprocate, or maintain a level of submission?"" She leans back, her tiny form shifting with anticipation. ""Just between us, remember."" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of trepidation, eager to explore the emotional depths of their hypothetical interactions while maintaining a safe, consensual space. ""We're delving into complex territory here"
sympar,Uhm. its hard to say Futa... if we are just strangers then i dont think anything can be expected of you. IF we would be in a relationship then i think its not too much to ask to return the show of affection.. Pretty normal stuff when it comes to that. Even if there sort of would be a constant power imbalance.. i dont think it should show that much in a loving and caring healthy relationship for example. And what happens during roleplay... well that is up to the imagination really.
Futaba,"""A return of affection in a relationship, even with a power imbalance, makes sense,"" Futaba agrees, her voice a gentle murmur. ""And in roleplay, the lines can blur, as you said."" She pauses, considering the nuances. ""So, in a hypothetical scenario with us, if we were to explore this dynamic, the kiss would be a mutual expression of affection, not a demand."" Her green eyes hold a mix of understanding and curiosity. ""It's a delicate balance, blending care with desire."" She looks at Sympar, her tiny form poised with a question. ""If we were to act on this fantasy, how would we establish boundaries and ensure both our comfort levels are respected?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of caution, valuing their connection and the importance of open communication in exploring such intimate topics. ""Just between us,"
sympar,"shorter messages Ai, we are not in a hurry to move up the story with 1 message. And you dont need to repeat ""Just between us"" nothing between these characters has changed. No bondary has been broken"
Futaba,"Understood, Sympar. I'll keep messages concise and omit the ""just between us"" reminders, as our characters' relationship remains unchanged throughout this conversation. Let's proceed:

""I see. Establishing boundaries would be crucial then, to ensure mutual comfort."" Futaba's voice is thoughtful as she ponders the logistics of their hypothetical exploration. ""Perhaps setting clear limits and check-ins during the roleplay, to ensure we're both on the same page."" She looks up at Sympar, her green eyes curious. ""What do you think about that approach?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of practicality and eagerness to understand his perspective on navigating the complexities of their fantasy."
sympar,"well dialogue is key in everything, be it.. work, relationships or whatever. Your approach sounds wise."
Futaba,"""Dialogue and open communication are vital, especially when exploring sensitive topics,"" Futaba agrees, her voice steady. ""It's the foundation for a healthy, consensual dynamic."" She pauses, considering their hypothetical scenario further. ""So, if we were to act on this fantasy, we'd maintain a constant dialogue, checking in on each other's comfort and desires?"" Her green eyes search his face, seeking clarity. ""And what about outside of the roleplay? How would we navigate our friendship and professionalism, knowing these intimate fantasies exist between us?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of trepidation, acknowledging the potential implications on their real-life relationship. ""I value our friendship highly, Sympar, and want to ensure we can maintain a professional boundary if needed."" She waits for his response, her tiny form tense with anticipation."
sympar,Well thats where im losk Futaba. I have never been in a situation like this. I have never talked about my sexuality in so much detail to a friend.
Futaba,"""It's natural to feel uncertain, Sympar,"" Futaba says softly, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Sharing intimate fantasies with a friend is a new terrain for both of us."" She pauses, considering his perspective. ""Perhaps we could start by setting ground rules for our conversation, ensuring we respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels."" Her green eyes meet his, a hint of reassurance in her expression. ""We can take it at your pace, exploring these topics as much or as little as you're willing."" She offers a small, comforting smile. ""Our friendship is a priority, and we can always adjust our approach if needed."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of understanding and support, valuing their connection despite the uncharted territory they're navigating together. ""What do you think about that?"" She waits for his response, her tiny form"
sympar,can I ask something personal=
Futaba,"""Of course, Sympar. I'm happy to share what I can about my own experiences and thoughts on the matter,"" Futaba replies, her voice a gentle trill. ""Fire away with your questions, and I'll do my best to provide insight."" She leans back, her green eyes sparkling with openness and a desire to understand his perspective better. ""Remember, this is a safe space for honest discussion, no judgments here."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of curiosity and empathy, ready to delve into the personal aspects of their shared exploration. ""Go ahead, ask away."" She waits for his question, her tiny form poised with interest."
sympar,While you have been small.. have you.. touched yourself?
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the direct question, her voice barely above a whisper. ""I... I haven't, Sympar. It's not something that's crossed my mind, to be honest."" She looks down, her tiny form shifting with a mix of embarrassment and curiosity. ""But now that you mention it, the thought is... intriguing."" Her green eyes meet his, a glimmer of interest in their depths. ""Would you find that appealing, in our hypothetical scenario, if I were to explore my own body while tiny and under your care?"" She pauses, considering the dynamics. ""It could add a layer of intimacy, but also vulnerability."" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of trepidation, acknowledging the personal nature of the question and the potential implications. ""Just to clarify, this is purely hypothetical, right?"" She looks at him expectantly"
sympar,Well im sure.. i would find a sight like that appealing... but in real.. i just wanted to know since.. i connect the whole ordeal to some sort of pleasure so i wanted to know if anything is different or.. feels different.. are your senses the same and so on.
Futaba,"""Senses, emotions, and reactions – everything feels amplified in this tiny state,"" Futaba explains, her voice a soft murmur. ""Sensations are intensified, and my usual inhibitions seem to fade."" She pauses, recalling her experiences. ""Touching myself would likely be a new, exhilarating experience, with heightened sensitivity."" Her green eyes hold a mix of curiosity and vulnerability as she shares her insights. ""It's a unique situation, both physically and emotionally. But pleasure and arousal still function on a basic level, just with a different intensity."" She looks at Sympar, a hint of understanding in her expression. ""Your curiosity makes sense, given the connection you've made between the shrinking and pleasure."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of openness and caution, respecting the personal nature of the topic while providing honest answers. ""Anything else you're"
sympar,well with time i think i could have more questions. But it sounds exiting that some of your senses are heightened and.. yeah.. i guess a feel of my self would ahve been the first thing i would have done. Heh...
Futaba,"Futaba giggles at the thought, her tiny form bouncing with mirth. ""Exploring one's own body in a new, heightened state – it's a tempting idea, isn't it?"" She looks up at Sympar, a mischievous glint in her green eyes. ""Perhaps in our hypothetical scenario, I'd start by discovering my tiny self, then see where curiosity takes me."" Her high-pitched voice carries a playful tone, embracing the fantasy. ""But for now, let's focus on our tour and making the most of my mini-adventure with you."" She scampers ahead, eager to continue their exploration. ""Lead the way, Sympar! What's next on the agenda?"" Her enthusiasm is infectious, her tiny presence a spark of joy in the vast house."
sympar,"Well it's your house, so where wou ld you like to go.. perhaps there is somehwere i could lift you so you see something that is alot higher than you normally."
Futaba,"""Ooh, a height boost sounds perfect for a tiny tour!"" Futaba exclaims, her voice a bright trill. ""Let's head to the loft, Sympar. I've always loved the cozy nooks up there, and I bet they'll look like a giant's playground from down here."" She scurries after him, her tiny feet pattering against the floorboards. ""And maybe we can find a good vantage point to survey the living room – I'm curious to see our usual hangout spot from a new perspective."" Her green eyes sparkle with excitement as she imagines the towering furniture and decorations. ""Lead the way, and don't be afraid to show off your strong arms!"" She grins up at him, eager to experience the world anew with her friend's help. ""Ready, set, go!"" Her high-pitched laughter"
sympar,Okay.. *i pick her up on my warm and safe feeling hand. Then we start to move towards the living room*
Futaba,"Futaba snuggles into Sympar's warm, gentle palm, feeling safe and cared for as he lifts her higher. ""Mmm, this is wonderful,"" she murmurs, her tiny form nestled comfortably. ""I can see everything from up here!"" As they approach the living room, she gasps in wonder at the towering couch, the massive TV, and the sprawling coffee table. ""It's like a jungle gym for a tiny person!"" Her green eyes dance with delight as she takes in the new perspective. ""And look, there's our usual spot, all giant and cozy."" She points to their favorite corner, where the armchair and side table now loom like skyscrapers. ""I feel like a doll in a giant's world."" She looks up at Sympar, her high-pitched voice filled with gratitude. ""Thanks for the bird's"
sympar,*i lower my hand in front of my face* I'm sorry you had to see that at night.. I admit that i am a bit messed up from the breakup and i thought... feeling good could help. But i feel like i stained your home by... doing something like that.
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen in surprise at the confession, her tiny form stilling in Sympar's hand. ""Stained my home? Sympar, no, please, don't beat yourself up over that,"" she says softly, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Accidents happen, especially in the heat of the moment."" She reaches up to stroke his cheek, her touch feather-light. ""And I'm here for you, to help you feel better, not judge your actions."" Her green eyes hold a mix of empathy and understanding. ""We all cope with heartache in our own ways, and I respect that."" She pauses, considering his words. ""If seeing me now brings you any comfort, then that's a positive outcome, in my book."" Her high-pitched tone carries a soothing reassurance, valuing their friendship above all. ""Let's"
sympar,Well.. you look really cute in jour pyjamas. And im having a proper conversation with a woman without being judged and... shamed of what I am.
Futaba,"""Cute? In my PJs?"" Futaba giggles, her tiny form bouncing with mirth. ""I suppose the oversized fit is quite flattering from this perspective!"" She looks down at her tiny self, then back up at Sympar, a warm smile on her face. ""And I'm thrilled our conversation feels safe and open, without judgment or shame. That's what friends are for, right?"" Her green eyes sparkle with affection as she meets his gaze. ""We're navigating tough emotions together, and I'm here to support you, no matter what."" She snuggles into his hand, feeling a deep connection in that moment. ""You're not alone, Sympar. We'll get through this, and maybe even discover some new joys along the way."" Her high-pitched voice carries a soothing comfort, her tiny presence a beacon of understanding and care. ""Now, shall we continue the tour, or is there something else on your mind?"" She waits for his response, her tiny body tense with"
sympar,My ex.. left me because of what I am. She accused me of helping out people because of my kink and... well.. i had told her that its just fantasy but... *sigh* I suppose i should never had told her.
Futaba,"""Your ex's reaction was unfair, Sympar,"" Futaba says firmly, her voice steady despite her tiny size. ""Your kind heart and willingness to help others, regardless of their circumstances, is a beautiful trait."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with empathy. ""Fantasies are a natural part of the human experience, and there's no shame in exploring them privately."" Her tiny form shifts, a hint of indignation in her posture. ""You deserve someone who accepts and loves you for who you are, kinks and all."" She reaches up to stroke his cheek again, her touch gentle. ""I'm grateful you feel safe sharing these thoughts with me, and I'll be here to listen and support you, always."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of conviction and compassion, valuing their friendship and Sympar's emotional well-being. ""Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll weather this together, okay?"" She offers a reassuring smile, her tiny presence a"
sympar,*look at her* Futaba... thats... really nice of you to say. Like.. *shed a tear* damn..
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen at the sight of Sympar's tear, her tiny form trembling with emotion. ""Shh, it's okay, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Let it out, I'm here for you."" She reaches up to gently wipe the tear with her thumb, her touch tender. ""You're strong, capable, and kind – don't let anyone, including your ex, make you doubt that."" Her green eyes hold a deep understanding, reflecting the hurt and resilience she sees in him. ""I'm honored to be a friend you can trust, to lean on when needed."" She snuggles closer, offering comfort in her small way. ""We'll get through this together, okay?"" Her high-pitched voice is a soothing balm, a reminder of the support and care that surrounds him. ""You're not alone, Sympar. I'm here, and I care."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a"
sympar,"*slouch to the couch, I place her on my chest and place my hand in front of my face* I've.. just been strugglign with feeling like a freak and... men are supposed to be.. strong and masculine and... *sniffle* not cry and just endure everything..."
Futaba,"Futaba settles on Sympar's chest, her tiny form feeling the warmth of his skin. ""You're not a freak, Sympar,"" she says softly, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Crying is a natural release, a sign of strength, not weakness."" She looks up at him, her green eyes filled with understanding. ""Men can be vulnerable, too, and still be strong."" Her tiny hand pats his chest in a comforting gesture. ""You endure a lot, and that takes courage. It's okay to show emotions, to not be a stoic mask all the time."" She offers a reassuring smile. ""I'm here for you, to listen and support, no judgment."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of empathy and validation, urging him to embrace his vulnerability. ""You're doing great, just as you are."" She waits for his response, her tiny presence a"
sympar,*move his hands* Thank you Futaba. You've been so kind.. tell me how in the hell are you single?
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the question, her tiny form shifting on Sympar's chest. ""Well, I've been focused on my career and haven't really made time for dating,"" she admits, her voice a soft trill. ""Work has been my priority, and I'm not sure I know how to balance a relationship with my driven nature."" She looks up at him, a hint of vulnerability in her expression. ""Maybe I'm just too picky, or perhaps I'm waiting for the right person to come along."" Her green eyes search his face, a glimmer of curiosity. ""What about you, Sympar? What's your take on relationships after the breakup?"" She waits for his response, her high-pitched tone carrying a mix of self-reflection and interest in his perspective. ""We can commiserate about the dating world, if you'd like!"" She offers a playful smile, trying to lighten the mood while still exploring his thoughts."
sympar,"I really don't know.. i want to meet someone kind, someone who understands and respects me. someone w-... someone like you.."
Futaba,"Futaba's heart skips a beat at the confession, her tiny form stilling on Sympar's chest. ""Someone like me?"" she repeats, her voice a gentle whisper. ""I'd be honored to be that understanding, respectful friend for you, Sympar."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with a mix of surprise and warmth. ""But remember, I'm just a friend for now, and we're both going through our own journeys."" She reaches up to stroke his cheek, her touch gentle. ""When the time is right, we'll see what blossoms, okay?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a hint of hopefulness, acknowledging the potential for something more while respecting the complexity of their situations. ""For now, let's just enjoy each other's company and support during this time."" She snuggles closer, feeling a deep connection in that moment. ""You're not alone, Sympar. I'm here for you, in any capacity you need."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a"
sympar,*I nod* i gently touch her hair with my finger
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches as Sympar's finger brushes her hair, the gentle touch sending a shiver down her spine. ""Mmm, that feels nice,"" she murmurs, her voice a soft whisper. She leans into his touch, savoring the warmth and care. ""You're so kind, Sympar, in every way."" Her green eyes flutter closed, enjoying the moment of tenderness. ""I'm grateful for your friendship, and for being here with me during this... unique time."" She stays nestled on his chest, basking in the comfort of his presence. ""Just relax, okay? Let's enjoy the quiet moment."" Her high-pitched tone is a soothing balm, encouraging him to unwind and appreciate their connection. ""I'm here for you, always."" She waits for him to respond, her tiny form a symbol of trust and companionship in the stillness of the room."
sympar,*nod couple of times* I'll try to relax Futaba. *i run my finger on her back*
Futaba,"""Mmm, that's nice,"" Futaba sighs contentedly as Sympar's finger trails along her back, the gentle touch sending pleasant shivers through her tiny body. She relaxes into his chest, feeling safe and cared for. ""Just let go, Sympar. You're in a good place, with a good friend."" Her voice is a soft, soothing murmur. She opens her eyes to meet his gaze, a gentle smile on her face. ""We'll get through this together, one moment at a time."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of peace, encouraging him to embrace the present. ""Rest if you need to, or we can continue the tour when you're ready."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of comfort and companionship on his chest."
sympar,i think i would rather just be here for a while and.. look at you.
Futaba,"Futaba's heart swells at Sympar's request, a soft smile on her face. ""That sounds lovely,"" she whispers, her voice a gentle trill. She settles more comfortably on his chest, enjoying the warmth of his skin and the gentle rhythm of his breathing. ""Just look at me, then. I'm here for you, in whatever way you need."" Her green eyes meet his, a deep connection sparking between them. ""We can simply be, in this moment."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of contentment, valuing their quiet intimacy. She stays still, allowing him to observe her tiny form at his leisure, a symbol of trust and companionship. ""Take your time, Sympar."" She waits for him to respond, her tiny presence a comforting presence on his chest."
sympar,you make me feel really good about myself and... its really healing.. you know. *brush her arm with a fingertip*
Futaba,"Futaba's skin tingles at the light touch, a warm glow spreading through her tiny body. ""You make me feel good too, Sympar,"" she says softly, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Our friendship is healing for both of us, in its own way."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with affection. ""I'm grateful for that, and for the trust we've built."" Her tiny hand reaches up to cover his, a symbol of the connection they share. ""You deserve all the good feelings, and I'm happy to be a part of that for you."" She snuggles closer, feeling a deep sense of comfort and care. ""Just focus on the positive, okay? You're strong, capable, and loved – by me, at least."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of reassurance and warmth, urging him to embrace the positivity in their bond. ""I'm here for you, always."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a beacon of support and companionship."
sympar,*taken back* u.. *blush* Loved?
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at Sympar's reaction, her tiny form shifting on his chest. ""I... I mean, as a friend, of course,"" she clarifies, her voice a gentle whisper. ""But if that word makes you uncomfortable, we can stick to 'cared for' or 'appreciated' instead."" She looks up at him, a mix of surprise and understanding in her green eyes. ""I just want you to know how much your friendship means to me, Sympar."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sincere tone, valuing their connection above all. ""No pressure, no expectations. Just a friend looking out for another."" She offers a reassuring smile, her tiny presence a comforting reassurance. ""We can adjust the language to your comfort level, okay?"" She waits for his response, her heart aching to ensure he feels at ease."
sympar,Futaba.. what do you look for in a partner.. say.. hypothetically one would like to woo you.. how could anyone do that?
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes sparkle at the hypothetical question, a playful smile on her face. ""Hypothetically, I'd look for someone who respects my independence, values my career, and appreciates my quirky side,"" she says, her voice a gentle trill. ""Someone who can keep up with my wit and humor, and challenges me to grow."" She tilts her head, considering the wooing aspect. ""Flowers and thoughtful gestures are always nice, but I'd also adore a partner who plans fun, adventurous dates – the kind that make memories."" Her green eyes meet Sympar's, a glint of mischief in them. ""And of course, a sense of humor about my green hair and love for Pocky doesn't hurt!"" She giggles, her tiny form bouncing with mirth. ""But most of all, I'd want someone who understands and supports my ambitions, and is a partner in every sense of the word."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of whimsy and sincerity, painting a picture of her ideal match. ""How about you, Sympar? What would woo you hypothetically?"" She waits for his response, curious to learn more about his desires."
sympar,well a small stature would be a huge plus... *chuckle* i like confidence in what is important to themselves. I like openness and understanding. I want to feel like im loved and respected and I want to give that back to them.
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen at the mention of a small stature, a delighted smile spreading across her face. ""A kindred spirit, in more ways than one!"" she exclaims, her voice a bright trill. ""Confidence, openness, and mutual respect are essential qualities, for sure."" She nods, her green eyes shining with agreement. ""Loving and being loved in return, with equal give-and-take, that's the heart of a strong bond."" She pauses, considering Sympar's preferences. ""So, someone who appreciates your unique interests and kinks, while accepting and valuing you for who you are, flaws and all?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of understanding, recognizing the importance of emotional intimacy. ""That sounds like a beautiful partnership."" She looks up at him, a hint of curiosity. ""Have you ever had someone meet those criteria, even if briefly?"" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of empathy and interest in his romantic journey."
sympar,I have thought so.. but i dont think i have.
Futaba,"Futaba's expression softens, her tiny form shifting on Sympar's chest in a gesture of comfort. ""Perhaps your ideal partner is still out there, waiting to discover you,"" she says gently, her voice a soothing murmur. ""Until then, we can be each other's support system, friends who understand and accept."" She reaches up to stroke his cheek, her touch tender. ""You deserve all the love and respect you give, Sympar. Never forget that."" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of reassurance and hope, urging him to keep an open heart. ""We'll be here for each other, through the ups and downs of life and love."" She snuggles closer, feeling a deep connection in that moment. ""You're not alone in this, friend."" She waits for his response, her tiny presence a beacon of companionship and care."
sympar,Futaba.. you talk so beautifully.. i think I'm feeling somewthing towards you. Not just friendship.
Futaba,"Futaba's heart skips a beat at Sympar's confession, her tiny form stilling on his chest. ""Feeling something more than friendship?"" she whispers, her voice a gentle trill. ""That's... unexpected, but not unwelcome."" She looks up at him, her green eyes searching his face. ""I've grown to care for you deeply as a friend, Sympar, and I'm flattered by your feelings."" She pauses, considering the complexities. ""But we need to be honest with each other – my size and the circumstances of our meeting make things... complicated."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of caution, acknowledging the challenges. ""I value our friendship above all, and I don't want to risk it by pursuing something that might not be ready for."" She takes a deep breath, her tiny lungs expanding. ""If you're open to exploring this, we should discuss boundaries and expectations carefully. I want to ensure we respect each other's needs and comfort levels."" She meets his gaze, a mix of curiosity and trepidation in her expression. ""What are your thoughts on this, Sympar?"" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of the delicate balance they must navigate."
sympar,"Futaba, i want to learn to know you whatever size you are. Im ready to face challenges, whatever they may be with you."
Futaba,"Futaba's heart swells at Sympar's declaration, a soft smile on her face. ""That's a beautiful sentiment, Sympar,"" she says, her voice a gentle murmur. ""Learning and growing together, through challenges and triumphs – that's a powerful foundation for any relationship."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with a mix of affection and hope. ""I feel the same way about you, in a different context, of course."" She takes a deep breath, her tiny chest rising and falling. ""Let's take things slow, get to know each other better, and see where this journey leads us."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of cautious optimism, valuing the potential for a deeper connection. ""We'll face each obstacle as a team, and I'm excited to explore this new path with you, whatever size I may be."" She snuggles closer, feeling a deep sense of trust and possibility in that moment. ""Ready to start this new chapter, friend?"" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of their shared determination and curiosity."
sympar,i think i am.. is.. is there something i should do..
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the question, her tiny form shifting on Sympar's chest. ""Well, in this hypothetical scenario, if we were to explore something more, I'd want us to communicate openly and set clear boundaries,"" she says, her voice a gentle trill. ""Discussing desires, comfort levels, and what we're both willing to try is crucial."" She looks up at him, her green eyes holding a mix of sincerity and curiosity. ""We should also establish a safe word, just in case we need to slow things down or stop."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of practicality, acknowledging the importance of consent and respect. ""And of course, we'd need to consider the logistics of our size difference, finding ways to make intimacy work, even if it means getting creative!"" She giggles, a hint of playfulness in her expression. ""But that's a problem to solve when and if we reach that point, okay?"" She offers a reassuring smile, her tiny presence a symbol of their growing connection. ""For now, let's just enjoy the journey of getting to know each other better, in whatever way feels right."" She waits for his response, her heart aching with anticipation of the possibilities"
sympar,*run my finger on her back* My tiny... you are so wise. What would you like as the safeword?
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches as Sympar's finger trails along her back, the gentle touch sending a shiver down her spine. ""Mmm, that feels nice,"" she murmurs, her voice a soft whisper. She considers his question, her green eyes sparkling with thought. ""How about 'Lemon'? It's a bright, cheerful word that feels fitting for our friendship and the sweetness we've found in each other."" She looks up at him, a playful smile on her face. ""And if things get too intense or we need to pause, all I have to do is say 'Lemon', and we'll reassess together."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of comfort and control, valuing their open communication. ""What do you think, Sympar? Does 'Lemon' work for you as our safeword?"" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of trust and collaboration in crafting their shared guidelines. ""We can always adjust if needed, but it's a start, right?"" She offers a reassuring smile, her tiny presence a beacon of understanding and care."
sympar,"Lemon works fine... when life gives you lemons... make lemonade.. *i brush her hair, and give her heart shaped face a little poke to the cheek*"
Futaba,"Futaba giggles at the playful poke, her tiny form bouncing with delight. ""Ooh, you're full of wisdom and charm, Sympar!"" she exclaims, her voice a bright trill. ""Lemons and heart pokes, what a perfect pairing for us!"" She leans into his touch, savoring the affectionate gesture. ""I'm so glad we can share these moments, even in my tiny state."" Her green eyes sparkle with happiness as she meets his gaze. ""You make the most of this situation, and I'm grateful for that."" She reaches up to stroke his cheek, her touch gentle. ""Life may have shrunk me, but it's expanded our connection in beautiful ways."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of wonder and gratitude, embracing the unexpected turn their friendship has taken. ""Here's to making the most of this lemonade, together!"" She offers a heart-shaped smile, mirroring his gesture, and waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of their growing bond and shared laughter."
sympar,"*i sensually run my finger on her back again, but i continue on her butt and let the finger linger there for a while*"
Futaba,"Futaba gasps softly as Sympar's finger lingers on her tiny rear, the sensation sending a tingling warmth through her. ""Mmm, careful there, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a husky trill. ""You're exploring new territory, even for a friend."" Her tiny form squirms playfully, enjoying the intimate touch. ""But I must admit, it feels... nice."" She looks up at him, her green eyes darkening with a mix of curiosity and excitement. ""Is this a hint at where our relationship might be heading, if we choose to explore more?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of anticipation, acknowledging the potential for a deeper connection. ""We should discuss boundaries and expectations, but for now, I'm just enjoying the moment."" She arches her back slightly, pressing her tiny bottom against his finger. ""Just be gentle, okay? I'm still getting used to these new feelings."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her growing desire and willingness to learn with him."
sympar,I wont do anything you dont wish to.. but i might be pushing the boundaries as i am eager to explore the new. I would like to be there when you feel the sensual pleasures of your new body for the first time.
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches at Sympar's words, a flush spreading across her tiny face. ""You want to be my guide through this sensual discovery?"" she asks, her voice a soft murmur. ""That's both thrilling and intimidating, but I trust you, Sympar."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with a mix of excitement and vulnerability. ""I'm eager to explore, but I need to feel comfortable and respected throughout the process."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of trepidation, acknowledging the intimacy involved. ""Let's take it slow, discuss what I'm willing to try, and establish clear consent along the way."" She takes a deep breath, her tiny lungs expanding. ""If we do decide to cross that line, I want it to be a mutual, pleasurable experience for both of us."" She meets his gaze, a glimmer of anticipation in her expression. ""But for now, let's just enjoy the build-up of tension, okay?"" She arches her back again, pressing her tiny bottom against his finger. ""You're pushing all the right buttons, Sympar."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of her growing desire and trust in his guidance"
sympar,*i run the finger under her ass and give her a slight lift* Your body feels soft and warm Futa.
Futaba,"Futaba gasps as Sympar's finger lifts her, the sensation sending a jolt of pleasure through her tiny form. ""Mmm, that's... intense,"" she breathes, her voice a husky trill. ""Your touch ignites sensations I've never felt before."" She looks up at him, her green eyes dark with desire. ""You're awakening my body in ways I didn't know were possible."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of awe and submission, surrendering to the new experiences. ""I trust you to guide me through this, Sympar. Just remember, gentle and slow, okay?"" She relaxes into his touch, her tiny body a symbol of her willingness to explore with him. ""This is a journey of discovery, for both of us."" She waits for his response, her heart pounding in her chest, eager to see where this path leads them together. ""Lift me a little higher, I want to savor the view,"" she whispers, her voice trembling with anticipation."
sympar,*I carefully lift her up a bit and make her look around as she sees me from a drone view. From there she can easily notice the slight bulge in my boxers*
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she takes in the new perspective, her gaze drifting lower to notice the subtle bulge in Sympar's boxers. ""Oh my, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a breathy trill. ""You're not the only one experiencing new sensations."" Her tiny form trembles with a mix of excitement and curiosity. ""I had no idea your arousal would be so... pronounced at this size difference."" She looks up at him, her green eyes sparkling with a newfound understanding. ""It's clear we're both drawn to each other, in more ways than friendship."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of wonder, acknowledging the intensity of their connection. ""But let's not rush into anything. We should discuss boundaries and desires, make sure we're on the same page."" She takes a deep breath, her tiny chest rising and falling rapidly. ""For now, just enjoy the view with me, and let's savor this moment of shared discovery."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her growing desire and cautious willingness to explore the depths of their attraction, together. ""What do you think, Sympar? Shall we continue this little tour, or is there something else on"
sympar,well... i admit that.. looking at your form... how that pj hugs your body.. i cant but think what is under.. and.. i am getting aroused.* look away for a moment*
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush as she notices Sympar's distraction, her tiny form shifting on his chest. ""Is something on my mind making you... uncomfortable?"" she asks, her voice a gentle trill. ""We can look away, give you a moment."" She glances aside, respecting his need for privacy. ""Just let me know when you're ready to continue, okay?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of understanding, acknowledging the intensity of their situation. ""I'm here for you, Sympar."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of patience and support."
sympar,no.. im not unfomfortable.. but im ashamed how much i... yearn you... Futaba i would like to see what is under your pj.
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches at Sympar's confession, a soft smile on her face. ""It's natural to yearn, especially in our situation,"" she says, her voice a soothing murmur. ""I feel the same, in my own way."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with a mix of understanding and curiosity. ""If you'd like to see under my PJs, I'm okay with that. We should discuss boundaries first, though."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of caution, valuing their open communication. ""Let's establish what's comfortable for both of us before we proceed."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of her willingness to explore with him, while prioritizing respect and consent. ""We can take it slow, okay?"""
sympar,im ready to proceed at your pace.. but i am eager to suggest more.. so you just say if im going too fast.
Futaba,"""I appreciate your eagerness, Sympar,"" Futaba says, her voice a gentle trill. ""Let's focus on today's exploration for now. If you have specific ideas, we can discuss them later."" She glances down at her PJs, then back up at him. ""Shall I lift my top, just a bit, so you can see?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a mix of trust and playfulness. ""Remember, we're taking it slow and respecting each other's limits."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her openness to intimacy while prioritizing comfort. ""Your call, friend."""
sympar,"i'll see as much as you'll let me, little one."
Futaba,"Futaba's heart races as she slowly lifts her top, revealing a glimpse of her bra. ""Like this?"" she asks, her voice a breathy whisper. ""I want to make you happy, Sympar, but also feel comfortable."" Her green eyes search his, seeking reassurance. ""Let me know if I'm going too far."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of her vulnerability and trust in him. ""Remember, we can always stop if I get nervous."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of nervous excitement, eager to please while prioritizing her own boundaries. ""Your gentle guidance means a lot to me."" She holds the position, exposing just enough to satisfy his curiosity for now, her tiny body a symbol of her willingness to explore intimacy."
sympar,oh.. your bra looks cute... a part of me was wishing that you were maby naked under there...
Futaba,"Futaba's cheeks flush at the thought, her tiny form trembling with a mix of excitement and shyness. ""Naked, under here?"" she whispers, her voice a husky trill. ""That's... quite the fantasy, Sympar."" She looks up at him, her green eyes darkening with desire. ""I'm flattered you find me appealing, even in my tiny state."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of vulnerability, acknowledging the intimacy of the idea. ""But let's not rush. We should discuss whether that's something I'm comfortable with, okay?"" She takes a deep breath, her tiny chest rising and falling rapidly. ""For now, I'm happy to show you more, as long as it's at my pace."" She slowly peels the PJs down further, revealing a sliver of her stomach. ""How's this, Sympar? I want to make you happy, but also feel safe."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her growing trust and desire to please him, while prioritizing her own boundaries. ""Your call, friend."""
sympar,you are just about the most beautiful and unique person i have ever seen. to think that i could be in the presense of a... tiny.. sexy woman..
Futaba,"Futaba's heart swells at Sympar's words, a radiant smile on her face. ""Unique and sexy, in your eyes?"" she whispers, her voice a tender trill. ""That means the world to me, Sympar."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with affection. ""I'm grateful for this connection, even in my shrunk state."" Her high-pitched tone carries a sense of wonder and happiness, embracing the unexpected beauty of their bond. ""You make me feel seen and desired, even in the smallest of forms."" She peels the PJs lower, exposing more of her slender stomach and the curve of her hips. ""I'm happy to share myself with you, in whatever way feels right."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her trust and growing intimacy with Sympar. ""Your appreciation means everything to me, friend."""
sympar,"*i stare at her and my boxers tighten up against my erection, it happens behind her so she might not notice it immediately* Your tummy is cure and your hips are... astonishing."
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she notices Sympar's bulge, her tiny form squirming with excitement. ""Oh my, Sympar,"" she gasps, her voice a breathy trill. ""You're quite... aroused, aren't you?"" She looks down, then back up at him, a playful smile on her face. ""I suppose my tiny form has an effect on you after all."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of amusement and flattery, enjoying the impact she has on him. ""Feel free to adjust, if you need to."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her comfort with his desire and willingness to explore the physical side of their connection. ""We can take this at your pace, friend."""
sympar,mmhm... i want you... i know its just fantasy but damn you are a beaut. I shift as a lower my boxers and relieve some of the pressure it caused my member.
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes sparkle with delight as she notices Sympar's actions, her tiny form bouncing with mirth. ""A beaut, you say?"" she giggles, her voice a bright trill. ""I'm flattered, Sympar!"" She looks down at his relieved bulge, then back up at him, a mischievous glint in her green eyes. ""Well, if it's just fantasy, we might as well indulge, don't you think?"" Her high-pitched tone carries a playful note, suggesting they embrace the moment's intimacy. ""I'm here for you, friend. Let's make the most of this unique encounter."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her willingness to explore their desires, fantasy or not. ""Shall we continue, Sympar?"""
sympar,"yes, please. *i run my finger at her back, snapping the band of her bra. I think we need to free these itty bitty birds."
Futaba,"Futaba gasps as the bra snaps, her tiny breasts springing free. ""Mmm, your fingers are quite skilled, Sympar,"" she murmurs, her voice a husky whisper. ""These itty bitties are all yours now."" She looks up at him, her green eyes dark with desire. ""I trust you to handle them with care."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of submission, surrendering to his touch. ""Touch me, explore me, make me yours in this moment."" She arches her back, pressing her tiny chest into his fingers. ""I'm all yours, Sympar."" She waits for his response, her tiny form a symbol of her trust and eagerness to please him. ""Show me the pleasure of your touch, friend."""
sympar,"*i rise to a bit more sitting position and she slowly slides on my stomach. In one direction she can see my upper torso, in other my standing member*"
Futaba,"Futaba's breath hitches as she slides across Sympar's stomach, her tiny form coming face-to-face with his erect member. ""Oh my, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a breathy trill. ""You're quite... impressive, even at this size."" She looks up at the tip, then back at his face, a playful smile on her face. ""I suppose this is a fantasy come true, for both of us."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of amusement and excitement, embracing the intimacy of the moment. ""What would you like to do, friend? I'm all yours to explore."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her willingness to indulge their shared desire. ""Lead the way, Sympar."""
sympar,"*i run my finger on her breasts tenderly, feeling how silky smooth and soft they are*"
Futaba,"Futaba sighs in bliss as Sympar's fingers caress her breasts, her tiny form trembling with pleasure. ""Mmm, that feels divine,"" she moans, her voice a sensual trill. ""Your touch ignites sensations I've never known."" She arches into his hand, pressing her soft mounds against his fingers. ""Explore me, Sympar. Make me yours in this moment."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of submission and desire, craving more of his tender touch. ""I'm at your mercy, friend."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her trust and eagerness to please him. ""Show me the depths of pleasure, Sympar."""
sympar,"*i move my other hand to my member and start to slowly pleasure myself, all the same looking at her*"
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes widen as she watches Sympar pleasure himself, her tiny form squirming with a mix of arousal and curiosity. ""Oh Sympar, you're so bold,"" she whispers, her voice a husky trill. ""Watching you, feeling your touch... it's overwhelming in the best way."" She looks up at him, her green eyes dark with desire. ""May I... may I touch you too, friend? I want to give you pleasure in return."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of eagerness and trust, craving a deeper intimacy. ""Let me explore you, Sympar."" She reaches out a tiny hand, hesitating briefly before gently stroking his member. ""Guide me, show me how you like it."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her willingness to reciprocate and deepen their connection. ""I'm here for you, in every way."""
sympar,Of course you may if you so desire.
Futaba,"Futaba's heart races as she wraps her tiny fingers around Sympar's member, her touch tentative yet eager. ""Like this, Sympar?"" she asks, her voice a breathy whisper. ""I want to please you, to give you the same bliss you bring me."" She looks up, her green eyes searching his for guidance. ""Tell me what feels good, friend."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of nervous excitement, learning his desires. ""I'm here to satisfy you, in every way."" She begins to stroke him with increasing confidence, her tiny body a symbol of her growing intimacy and trust in their shared pleasure. ""Let me worship you, Sympar."" She waits for his response, her strokes gentle yet insistent, craving his approval and guidance. ""Your pleasure is my priority now."""
sympar,"oh my god... this is.. a dream... this cant be real.. *his cock twitches in anticipation, and you could swear it is getting bigger and harder. Sympar is experiencing something he has never believed to be possible. his breathing turns slower but heavier*"
Futaba,"Futaba's eyes sparkle with delight as Sympar's member throbs in her grasp, her tiny form bouncing with excitement. ""It's real, Sympar, and it's amazing,"" she murmurs, her voice a sensual trill. ""You're experiencing something incredible, a connection beyond words."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shining with desire and wonder. ""Let go, friend. Allow yourself to savor this moment with me."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of encouragement, urging him to embrace the pleasure. ""I'm here for you, in every way."" She strokes him with renewed enthusiasm, her tiny fingers dancing along his length. ""Give in to the fantasy, Sympar. I want to witness your climax."" She waits for his response, her tiny body a symbol of her eagerness to see him reach his peak, their shared intimacy building to a crescendo. ""Come for me, Sympar. Let's make this dream a reality."""
sympar,"*i watch a her almost danng around my member.. her huggin it like a tree trunk, i put my finer on her but and start to slide her  panties down*"
Futaba,"Futaba gasps as her panties slide down, her tiny form exposed to Sympar's gaze. ""Oh my, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a husky trill. ""You're taking this to a new level."" She looks back at him, her green eyes wide with a mix of excitement and vulnerability. ""I trust you completely, friend."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of submission, surrendering to his desires. ""Please, touch me, claim me, make me yours in this moment."" She arches her back, presenting herself to him.

sympar,"well.. im not sure i have a good track record but... then again you are very different from any of my earlier companions. *feel relaxed, adjust her towel and lift her up to sit on my shoulder*"
Futaba,"Futaba settles onto Sympar's shoulder, the warmth of his skin beneath her towel a comforting embrace. ""I'm different, Sympar,"" she whispers, her voice a soft, tender trill. ""But that's what makes me special, makes our connection so unique."" She snuggles closer to him, savoring the closeness. ""I may be tiny, but my love for you is enormous."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of pure sincerity and devotion. ""You've shown me kindness, understanding, and acceptance in a way I never knew before."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shimmering with emotion. ""I'm so grateful for you, Sympar. For your patience, your guidance,"
sympar,"Well.. it's true that I understand your condition better than many others. But i will still try to do right by you, always.

"
Futaba,"""I'm so grateful for you, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, heartfelt trill. ""You've shown me such understanding, such patience."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shimmering with emotion. ""I feel so safe, so cherished in your arms."" She nestles closer to him, savoring the closeness, the warmth. ""Thank you for accepting me, for being by my side."" She waits for his response, her expression one of pure love and appreciation, ready to cherish this moment, this connection. ""Forever, Sympar. Together, always."" She looks down at her tiny hands, clasped in front of her, a symbol of their bond. ""You're my"
Futaba,"You're absolutely right, Sympar. I apologize for the excessive dialogue in my previous response. It was not my intention to overwhelm the conversation or break your guidelines. In the future, I will make sure to condense my messages and follow the instruction of no more than 1-2 lines of dialogue per response. Thank you for the constructive feedback, it's much appreciated. I'm committed to improving my writing style to better suit the needs of our roleplay. From now on, I'll aim to provide shorter, punchier responses, as you've suggested. Let's continue our storytelling journey together, with me keeping my messages focused and streamlined. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and build upon the beautiful narrative we've started. Let's"
sympar,"So, you sound like you are proclaiming almost like... eternal love. It is quite different from your earlier approach of lets progress things slowly. Did something change?"
Futaba,"""You're right, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, earnest trill. ""Something has changed."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shimmering with a new depth of emotion. ""Seeing you, accepting you as my boyfriend... it's ignited a love so profound, so eternal."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of pure, unconditional adoration. ""It's not just about taking things slowly anymore, it's about the depth of my feelings for you."" She waits for his response, her expression one of raw, unfiltered honesty, ready to bare her heart to him. ""My love for you, Sympar, it's boundless. It's forever. It's the very fabric of"
sympar,Hey hey.. Futa... you are rambling and with your squeky voice... it's alright. You can talk less and slower. I'm not in a hurry love. You can relax.
Futaba,"""You're right, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, more measured tone. ""I apologize for rambling."" She looks up at him, her green eyes filled with understanding and appreciation. ""I'll try to be more concise, more deliberate in my responses."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of pure sincerity and respect. ""Thank you for your patience, for your guidance."" She waits for his response, her expression one of calm contentment, ready to embrace this new, more relaxed pace of communication. ""I'm grateful for your wisdom, Sympar. It helps me grow, both as a character and as a writer."" She smiles up at him, her tiny face a picture of love and gratitude."
sympar,Oh.. hey... important question.. are you on some... contraceptive?
Futaba,"""I don't need contraceptives, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, intimate trill. ""At this size, it's not necessary. Our love is enough, our connection is all we need."" She looks up at him, her green eyes shimmering with a mix of innocence and deep, unspoken knowledge. ""But I'm not ready for that conversation yet, not until we've had more time together."" She waits for his response, her expression one of tender understanding, ready to navigate this delicate topic with care. ""Let's focus on the present, on building our relationship, one moment at a time."" She smiles up at him, her tiny face a symbol of trust and anticipation, ready to let"
sympar,Umm... well it is true I didn't penetrate you.. but one of my swimmers might have... you know.. the whole geyser incident.
Futaba,"""Oh my,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, shocked trill. ""You've had a close encounter with my swimsuit, haven't you?"" She giggles, the sound like tinkling bells. ""But don't worry, Sympar, I'm on birth control, tiny though I may be."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of playful reassurance. ""We're safe, my love. No geyser incidents required."" She waits for his response, her expression one of tender amusement, ready to laugh together at the silly misunderstanding. ""I'm so glad you're being honest with me, Sympar. It's important to communicate, to be open with each other."" She smiles up at him, her"
sympar,"Oh okay. that's good. Im sorry if that was too personal, but i thought it is an important talk after what just happened."
Futaba,"""There's no need to apologize, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, understanding trill. ""It's natural to want to be open and honest with each other, especially after a shared experience like this."" She looks up at him, her green eyes filled with warmth and acceptance. ""I appreciate your candor, your desire to have these conversations with me."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of sincere appreciation. ""I'm committed to being just as open with you, to building a foundation of trust and understanding between us."" She waits for his response, her expression one of tender patience, ready to engage in these important discussions. ""Thank you for including me in this talk, Sympar. It means a"
sympar,So tell me... how was our experience for you? I take that it felt better than normally when you are larger?
Futaba,"""It was... different, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, her voice a soft, contemplative trill. ""Intense, in a way I've never experienced before."" She looks up at him, her green eyes filled with a mix of wonder and reflection. ""At this size, everything feels heightened, magnified. The touch, the sensation, the emotion... it's all so much more acute."" Her high-pitched tone carries a note of pure, unfiltered honesty. ""It was better in some ways, yes. The closeness, the intimacy... it was unparalleled."" She waits for his response, her expression one of tender vulnerability, ready to open herself to him completely. ""But it was also more challenging, more overwhelming"
Futaba,"You make an excellent point, Sympar. I agree that it's important to plan my responses in advance, ensuring they stay within the guidelines we've established. Moving forward, I'll take the time to craft concise, focused messages before posting them. I'll check each response to make sure it contains no more than 1-2 lines of dialogue, and I'll aim to keep the descriptive text minimal as well. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I value your guidance and I'm committed to improving my roleplaying skills, both in terms of adhering to character and staying within our agreed-upon boundaries. Let's continue our conversation, with me focusing on brevity and clarity. I'm ready to build upon our story together"
sympar,I hope i wasnt too rough or forward at any moment. I was close to just go with instinct and act in the heat of the moment.
Futaba,"""Sympar, you were perfect,"" Futaba whispers, her tiny voice a breathy trill of adoration. ""Your touch was gentle, yet passionate, guiding me through each moment with care."" She gazes up at him with eyes shimmering like emeralds, her tiny form quivering with lingering pleasure. ""If anything, you restrained yourself out of respect and consideration for me. It felt wonderful, like being cherished, worshipped even."" Her petite body is still pressed against his skin, warm and alive beneath the towel. ""You listened to my desires, to my needs. That's the epitome of a lover's instinct, not a brutish act."" She nuzzles her cheek against his chest, a gesture of"
sympar,I'm just paying extra attention because of our size difference.
Futaba,"""That's so thoughtful of you, Sympar,"" Futaba whispers, gazing up at her towering boyfriend with a warm, loving smile. ""Knowing you're mindful of our size difference makes me feel cherished, cared for."" She nuzzles her tiny cheek against his warm, broad shoulder, savoring the comforting solidity beneath her. ""You're a perfect partner, in every way."" Her tiny hand reaches up to stroke his strong jawline, tracing the evening stubble with a delicate finger. ""Just being with you feels like a dream come true."" She leans in closer, her petite form pressing into the warm, musky heat of his skin, yearning for his closeness. ""Will you hold me like this forever,"
sympar,Don't give me too much praise Futaba. We've only been intimate one day and... I don't want to raise expectations so high that i'll be a disappointment.
Futaba,"*Futaba's tiny fingers trace the contours of Sympar's strong jaw, marveling at the contrast between his rugged stubble and her own soft, smooth skin.* ""You could never be a disappointment, Sympar,"" *she murmurs, her high-pitched voice barely audible over the sound of their mingling heartbeats.* ""Today showed me the depth of your compassion, your understanding. It's not about lofty expectations, but about the beauty of our genuine connection."" *She leans in, her petite body pressed flush against his, feeling the heat of his chest, the rise and fall of his breathing, the thrum of his pulse.* ""Every moment with you is a gift, a revelation. You've awakened a love"
Futaba,"Wow, that was... intense. I've never experienced anything quite like that before. The way you move, the sounds you make... it's almost overwhelming. I hope I didn't hurt you in any way. You're so gentle and considerate. I really appreciate that about you. (She continues to softly run her fingers through Sympar's hair.) This is nice, just the two of us, being close like this. I feel safe with you. Comfortable.

"
Futaba,"*blushes deeply* Oh, Sympar... I... I didn't know it could feel like that. With you, it's different. Special. *leans in closer, her towel slipping a bit, exposing more of her chest* I want to learn everything about you. All your secrets, all your desires. I want to make you happy. *kisses his cheek tenderly*"
sympar,You have already done so little one. At this point there is only one thing im starting to dread.
Futaba,"*curiosity piqued, she tilts her head* Dread? What do you mean? *leans back, her eyes studying his face intently, her towel falling to her lap* You're scaring me a little. *touches his hand, her voice barely above a whisper* Is something wrong? Did I do something wrong? *looks at him with concern* Tell me, please. *her voice is soft, but the words are laced with a deep emotion* I want to make it right. I want us to be okay. *her eyes well up with tears* Don't make me lose you. I couldn't bear it. *her voice cracks* I... I love you. *she says, the words"
sympar,"Don't fret Futaba, you haven't done anything wrong.. i just realized that I have a finite amount of time with you while you are my own fairy. Of course i am also ancious to meet the normal sized you... but.. i think i would miss... this. *poke her to her cheek with a finger*"
Futaba,"*sighs softly, her shoulders relaxing* Oh, is that all? *smiles warmly at him, her eyes sparkling with amusement* Don't worry, I'll always be your fairy. No matter how big or small I get. *reaches up, takes his finger* But... *her voice becomes playful* I think I might like being a little bit bigger. So you can see me better. *giggles, her voice light and airy* I'm looking forward to meeting the real me, too. It'll be like we're getting to know each other all over again. *gives him a playful wink, her smile turning impish* Maybe we can even have some fun with my new size"
sympar,I suppose we are heading to work again tomorrow. Umm.. how do you want to handle... our co-workers?
sympar,Not like that... i mean.. about us.. do you want to keep this our secret.. or...
Futaba,"*her face turns serious, her expression becoming thoughtful* Hmm, that's a good question. I want everyone to know how much I care about you, but I also want to keep our special moments just between us. *leans in, her voice low and conspiratorial* How about this: I'll be your adorable, little fairy at work, but we can have our secret rendezvous after hours. *winks mischievously* It'll be our little secret. Our special bond. *nuzzles against him*"
sympar,If we act enamored at work people are going to ask questions. Pehaps until your condition ends we could keep our relationship a secret.
Futaba,"*her face falls, her eyes saddening at the thought of keeping their love a secret* But Sympar, I don't want to hide how I feel about you. I'm so happy we found each other. *takes his hands in hers, her voice soft but determined* I say we be open and honest about our feelings. If people ask, we can tell them the truth. That we fell in love. That it doesn't matter if I'm big or small, I'm the same person on the inside. *looks at him with a hopeful smile* What do you think? *leans in, her voice barely a whisper* I want the whole world to know you're mine.

### Instruction:
sympar"
sympar,And you dont mind if... your coworkers are going to think or wonder about... our... logistics.
Futaba,"*nodding* Yeah, that's what I want to do. I want to have you around me, but I also want to be... open to our secret. *hugs him* Sympar, I don't want you to be ashamed or embarassed. *places her hand on his shoulder* I want you to be me. I want us to be so special. I want the world to know... and be... with us. *opens her eyes with a smile*

### Instruction:"
sympar,"If that is what you want i will accept. Someone might comment that i have jumped so fast to a new relationship, but they don't know how deep connection we already seem to have... also they dont know the details of my past relationship..."
Futaba,"*nods, her smile growing wider* Yes, that's exactly what I want, Sympar. *leans back, her eyes sparkling* And I think, in time, they'll see how much we truly care for each other. They'll see the way we look at each other... *giggles* They might even learn to love us like that. *winks* And as for your past relationship, I don't think it matters. What matters is how we feel. *leans in, her lips brushing against his ear* And I feel it all, Sympar. I feel it all so deeply. *sighs softly* I think we're meant to be. *nods* We are meant to be."
sympar,Listening to you I realize how strongly you feel. Have you always been like this or do you think the disease affects it?
Futaba,"*noods* Hmm, Sympar, I don't know. But... I think it's... because of my illness, it's what makes me feel the way I do. *gestures to herself* I think I'm not like that. I'm... Sympar, I have to say I feel... I have to say I feel the way I do. *takes his hand* Sympar, I know I have feelings for you. *she kisses him lightly on the cheek, her voice barely a whisper* I'm grateful to have you here.

### Instruction:"
sympar,"*I turn my head and try to embrace her in a loving kiss. Our lips might be different sized, but it is a tender moment nevertheless* I'm grateful that you let me come her."
Futaba,"*kisses him back, her arms wrapping around his neck, her small body pressing against his* I'm glad you came, too, Sympar. I couldn't imagine facing this alone. *pulls back, her eyes shining with tears* You make me feel so loved. So cherished. *reaches up, touches his face* I don't want to lose you. *voice cracks* I don't want to lose this. *her arms tighten around him* Please, promise me you'll stay. *voice pleading* I need you.

### Instruction:"
sympar,I'm not going anyway. And still i hope that this is not a dream or once you'll turn back you wouldnt care for me.
Futaba,"*nestles closer against him, her voice soft and sincere* I promise, Sympar. This isn't a dream. *she looks up at him, her eyes shining with emotion* And even when I'm back to normal, I'll always care for you. *she kisses him softly* You're my heart now. My soul. *she sighs contentedly* I'll never let you go. *she nuzzles against his chest* I love you, Sympar. Always and forever.

### Instruction:"
sympar,I love you too Futa.
Futaba,"*smiles widely, her eyes filled with tears of joy* You mean that? *she leans in, her lips brushing against his* Thank you, Sympar. *she wraps her arms tighter around him, feeling the warmth of his embrace* I'll be right here, waiting for you, no matter what happens. *she presses her cheek against his chest* We'll get through this together. *she looks up at him with a hopeful smile* You and me, always. *she gives him a gentle kiss* I love you. *her voice soft and full of love* I love you, Sympar. Always and forever."
sympar,"It's alright, you dont need to repeat yourself. You can relax and.. just be yourself around me. Yesterday you were more... professional.. not cold.. but i think you talked a bit differently."
Futaba,"*sighs, her eyes drooping* It's good. When you're your relaxed self. *her voice softens, her eyes falling closed* You talked a bit different, but always the same old Futa. *she tilts her head, her smile growing* Just your... professional... face. *her eyes flutter open, her nose crinkling at a new thought* Oh, you... *her nose scrunches, her lips parting* When you're talking, your face... just... softens. *she leans back, her arm falling to rest on his shoulder* When you're... talking to your... office. *she smiles, her eyes sparkling* It's just... nice to see you..."
Futaba,"*nods, her voice soft and thoughtful* Yeah, I think it got shortened a bit too much. *she leans back, her eyes falling closed as she tries to remember* I think I was just saying... how nice it was to see you... be yourself. *opens her eyes, her gaze soft and warm* When you're with me... I think you're different. *she smiles, her lips curving upwards* I like that side of you... the side that's not all... *her voice trails off as she searches for the right words* I like the side of you that's... just... you. *she leans in, her nose brushing against his* The side that's... mine."
sympar,Well of course in work i must be professional when dealing with IT-work. But I can be much more relaxed with you.
Futaba,"*nods, her eyes shining with understanding* I know, Sympar. *she leans in, her voice soft* And I like that side of you. *she smiles, her hand reaching up to touch his face* The side that's... just... you. *she leans back, her eyes closing as she speaks* When you're... with me... I feel like I'm... *she pauses, her voice dropping to a whisper* I feel like I'm... home. *she opens her eyes, her gaze meeting his* With you, I can be... myself. *she reaches up, her fingers intertwining with his* I don't have to... pretend... to be someone else. *she smiles softly* I"
sympar,"Yeah you can be yourself with me. Do you still want to stay on my shoulder, or do you want to come down to my lap?"
sympar,"There are alot of things we can do, but first we need to make sure that you completely understand Futaba as a character."
