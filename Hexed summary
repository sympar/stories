Robert Matheson returns home from his semester abroad in Australia, his mind still filled with vivid memories of sun-kissed bodies and wild parties. He's utterly unprepared for the sight that greets him: his mother, Beth, has undergone a striking transformation into a vision of mature, radiant sensuality. Her once-modest curves now strain enticingly against her clothes, her skin glowing with an ethereal allure that leaves Robert disconcertingly aroused.

Over an increasingly charged dinner, Beth teases him with subtle touches and cryptic hints of significant life changes. The air crackles with unspoken tension, leaving Robert squirming in his seat, trying desperately to hide his growing erection from his mother's knowing gaze.

That night, jet-lagged and confused by his forbidden desires, Robert raids the fridge. He discovers a tantalizing blueberry pie, its aroma reminiscent of his mother's intoxicating perfume. Ignoring a strange warning note, he devours a large slice, savoring the sweet juice on his tongue before falling into a fitful sleep filled with erotic dreams of Beth.

Robert awakens to a shocking and arousing discovery - he's shrunk to a mere 9 inches tall, his body grotesquely altered in ways that both terrify and excite him. His genitals, now disproportionately large, throb with an intense, supernatural energy. Panicked and painfully aroused, he calls out for help.

Beth rushes in, her nightgown clinging to her voluptuous form. Her initial shock gives way to a mixture of guilt and undisguised lust. She reveals her identity as a witch, explaining the accidental hex cast through the pie that has created an unexpected psychic and physical link between them. As she speaks, Robert can feel her arousal mirrored in his own body, their magical connection amplifying every sensation to an almost unbearable degree.

As Robert grapples with his new size and heightened libido, Beth struggles to maintain her maternal role. However, the sight of her son's transformed state, with his grotesquely enlarged member, ignites a blazing fire within her that she can't ignore. Their relationship dynamics shift dramatically, forcing them to confront uncomfortable truths and forbidden desires.

Beth attempts to reverse the spell but discovers it's beyond her current abilities. In a moment of weakness, she gently caresses Robert's tiny form, causing them both to gasp at the intensity of the sensation. They're left to navigate this bizarre and increasingly erotic situation together, their bodies and minds intertwined in ways they never imagined possible.

The chapter climaxes with a tense moment of accidental intimacy. Believing she's protecting Robert from a perceived threat, Beth instinctively presses him against her heaving bosom. The contact sends shockwaves of forbidden pleasure through both of them, leaving them trembling and achingly aroused. They break apart, panting and flushed, grappling with overwhelming guilt and confusion.

As night falls, Robert lies alone in his room, his enlarged member throbbing insistently. He's assaulted by vivid, shared dreams with Beth - visions of her as an insatiable goddess, her enormous form dominating his world. In the dream, she tenderly pleasures his diminutive body, each touch sending jolts of ecstasy through him.

He wakes, sweating and painfully hard, torn between shame and desperate need. The chapter ends with Robert staring at his bedroom door, wondering if Beth is awake and equally aroused, pondering how deep this rabbit hole goes and whether he has the strength - or desire - to resist its irresistible pull.

As dawn breaks, Robert awakens to find his body still miniaturized, his enlarged genitals throbbing with magical energy. Beth enters his room, her voluptuous form barely contained by a sheer nightgown. The psychic link between them pulses with shared arousal as Beth gently lifts Robert's tiny form.

Unable to resist their mutual desire, Beth brings Robert to her bedroom. She places him on her soft, expansive breasts, his diminutive body dwarfed by her curves. Robert explores Beth's massive form, his touch sending waves of pleasure through their shared connection. Beth moans softly, her nipples hardening beneath Robert's ministrations.

Their explorations intensify as Beth guides Robert lower, his enlarged member sliding between the slick folds of her labia. The magical bond amplifies every sensation, causing them both to cry out in ecstasy. Robert's entire body becomes an instrument of pleasure as he thrusts against Beth's most sensitive areas.

Guilt and desire war within them, but the hex's influence proves too strong. They climax simultaneously, their shared orgasm magnified by their supernatural connection. In the aftermath, they lie together, panting and conflicted.

As days pass, they struggle to maintain normalcy while secretly indulging in increasingly daring sexual encounters. Beth uses her magic to create illusory scenarios - Robert finds himself making love to a giantess in a fairy grove, or pleasuring Beth as she towers over a miniature city.

Their magical experiments lead to unexpected developments. During one intense session, Robert temporarily regains his normal size, only to shrink again at the moment of climax. This discovery adds a new dimension to their lovemaking, with size changes becoming part of their erotic play.

Beth's powers grow alongside her sexual awakening. She learns to manipulate Robert's size at will, sometimes growing herself to tower over him. Their lovemaking takes on cosmic proportions, with Beth as a literal sex goddess and Robert her willing supplicant.

However, the emotional toll of their taboo relationship begins to weigh on them. Moments of post-coital clarity bring waves of shame and confusion. They promise to stop, only to be drawn back together by the hex's irresistible pull and their own unquenchable desires.

The chapter culminates in a marathon lovemaking session that pushes the boundaries of their magical and physical limits. As they lie spent in each other's arms, they realize their lives have been irrevocably changed. The question that hangs between them is whether they can find a way forward together, or if the cost of their passion is too high to bear.
